# The Story Map Building and Visualization Tool (SMBVT)

Project collaborators: Valentina Bartalesi, NicolÃ² Pratelli, Emanuele Lenzi

Developers: Emanuele Lenzi, Daniele Metilli (for the previous NBVT)

The Story Map Building and Visualization Tool (SMBVT) is semi-automatic tool to construct and visualise narratives, intended as semantic networks of events related to each other through semantic relations, in form of story maps and timeline. The tool was developed as an extension of a previously developed tool called Narrative Building and Visualisation Tool (NBVT - http://dlnarratives.eu/tool/index.html). SMBVT, like NBVT does, obeys an [ontology for narratives](https://dlnarratives.eu/ontology.html) we developed.

# Dependencies
In order to use ``SMBVT``, you need to install some softwar first:
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/)
- if you want install the system locally in your machine, you need a software like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/it/index.html) that provides the apache web server and the latest versions of PHP 

After installing PostgreSQL, you need to create a database and import the two tables contained in the SQL folder. The config file to update with your connection data is in try/PgConn.php.
After installing Apache Jena Fuseki, you need to create a dataset called "narratives" and the public endpoint "narratives/query"
In the end, you can use an FTP client (as Filezilla) in order to upload all the file on your space server, or in the folder htdocs if you are using XAMPP locally in your machine
